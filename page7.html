<b>How does an agent 'learn' values? </b> <p></p>

<p></p>
If we were to approach the grid with no prior knowledge, we can assume that all $Q(s,a) = 0$.

<p>Recall that $Q(s,a) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})]$. We have two assumptions: 1) once a square has been used in a policy, it has been 'activated' and returning to it will not yield any additional rewards.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="column">
<b>Step 1 </b> <p></p> is to move off-the-grid to Square 0. We receive a reward ($r_t$) of +1 and can update our Q-values. 
<p> For Square 0: We update the $r_t$ value: $Q(s_t,a_t) = 1 + 0 = 1$ </p>

<b>Step 2</b> <p></p> Assessing next steps, all actions ${a_t}$ (right, down, right-diagonal) seem to lead to equally desirable $s_{t+1}$ (squares 1, 4, and 5)  – each potential $s_{t+1}$ has a Q-value of 0. <p></p>
 is to move to Square 1 and receive a reward ($r_t$) of -1. We can update the Q-value for Square 1. 
<p> For Square 1: We update the $r_t$ value: $Q(s_t,a_t) = -1 + 0 = -1$ </p>
</div>

<p><b>And so on, until the end of the training episode.</b></p><p> For the following policy: Square 0 - 1 - 5 - 9 - 10 - 14 - 15
we get the values. </p>

<div id="grid5"></div>
<script src="grids/grid17.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>

<b>Training Episode 2 </b><p></p> We follow a 'greedy' policy, which means we select the highest value states without exploring further. I select Square 0 (which has a $Q(s_t, a_t) = 1$), as it is the only legal action. I  receive +1. The maximum $Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ is higher than it was in the previous training episode. <p></p>
For Square 0, update the $max. Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ value to 1: <p></p>
<p>$Q(s_t,a_t) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})] = 1+1 = 2$</p>

By following the policy, we move from Square 5 - Square 10 - Square 15. 
<p>For Square 5, update the $max. Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ value to 1 : $Q(s_t,a_t) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})] = 1+1 = 2$ </p>
<p>For Square 10, update the $max. Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ value to 1 : $Q(s_t,a_t) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})] = 1+1 = 2$ </p>
<p>For Square 15, the update does not change the previous Q value : $Q(s_t,a_t) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})] = 1+0 = 1$ </p>

<b>Training Episode 3</b><p></p> Select Square 0 (which has a $Q(s_t, a_t) = 2$), as it is the only legal action, and receive +1. The maximum $Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ is higher than it was in the previous training episode. <p></p>
For Square 0, update the $max. Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ value to 1: <p></p>
<p>$Q(s_t,a_t) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})] = 1+2 = 3$</p>

Follow the policy again, and move from Square 5 - Square 10 - Square 15. 
<p>For Square 5, update the $max. Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ value to 2 : $Q(s_t,a_t) = r_{t} + max[(Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})] = 1+1 = 3$ </p>
<p>For Squares 10 and 15, the update does not change the previous Q value</p>

In <b>training episode 4</b><p></p> the Q-value of Square 0 is updated to 4. In all subsequent training episodes, the Q-values stay the same. This is known as <b>'convergence' </b>. The trained agent has learned the Q-values, and will know how to follow the optimal policy <p></p>

<p></p><b>Learning Rate </b> <p></p>
The illustration above has several simplifying assumptions that allow us to 'update' Q-values by replacing them with the most recent calculation (e.g. we find the optimal policy in the first training episode, and we always follow a greedy policy). But this  doesn't allow for any randomness in the grid. For example – what if Square 15 has a reward of +10 with 50% probability, and -100 with 50% probability? In the method above, our Q-value for Square 15 would swing to capture the most recent reward, and wouldn't indicate the average behaviour. In addition, the values wouldn't converge. <p></p>

We manage this with a learning rate $\alpha$, which controls the speed of learning. 

Instead of what we were doing before: 
$$Q(s,a) = Q(s,a)_{new}$$
Which can be represented as $$Q(s,a) =  Q(s,a)_{old} + [Q(s,a)_{new} - Q(s,a)_{old}] $$

We now include the learning rate $\alpha$.
$$Q(s,a) =  Q(s,a)_{old} + \alpha[Q(s,a)_{new} - Q(s,a)_{old}]$$

When $\alpha = 1$, we are learning by completely replacing the old Q-value with the new Q-value (as in the previous examples). If $\alpha = 0$, we are not learning at all. 

To make this more concrete, let us consider the example where Square 15 has a 50% probability of +10, and 50% probability of -100. <p></p>
<b>Option 1: $\alpha = 1$ or $Q(s,a) = Q(s,a)_{new}$ </b> <p></p>
Here, we learn in the same fashion as the previous example. In the first training episode, Square 15 reveals a reward of +10. In the second, -100. In the third, +10. Look at the Q-values as they update over the three episodes. Unlike in the previous example, the values will not converge in the 4th training episode – they will continue to swing back-and-forth. <p></p>

</div>  
</div>
<p></p>
<b>Option 2: $\alpha = 0.9$</b> <p></p>
When $\alpha = 0.5$, the update rule is: $$Q(s,a) =  Q(s,a)_{old} + 0.5[Q(s,a)_{new} - Q(s,a)_{old}]$$ 
Now, let's follow the same sequence. In the first step, we move from off-the-grid to Square 0. We update the Q-value of Square 0 as follows:<p></p>
<p>$Q(s,a)_{old} = 0$ </p> 
<p>$Q(s,a)_{new} = r_t + max[(Q(s_{t+1}), a_{t+1})] = 1 + 0 = 1$ </p> 
<p>$Q(s,a) =  Q(s,a)_{old} + 0.5[Q(s,a)_{new} - Q(s,a)_{old}] = 0 + 0.5[1-0] = 0.5$ </p>
And so on. As can be seen, the Q-values will not converge in the 4th training episode, but -eventually - they will begin to tend towards the expected value for Square 15, which is -45 $[(0.50*-100) + (0.50*10)]$, representing that -on-average- it is not a desirable state.

<p><b>Introducing Exploration and Discounting</b> <p></p>
<p>As described previously, we can include exploration (using the $\epsilon$-greedy strategy - described in <a href = ="new_page4.html">Section 4</a>), and include discount factor in our value calculations (described in <a href = ="new_page3.html">Section 3</a>).</p>
