Reinforcement learning is a method of learning that relies on interaction with an environment. It can be considered a computational approach to how a child learns – we learn how to walk without an explicit teacher, and instead learn which actions to take through trial-and-error, and identifying cause and effect in relation to our physical movement and the environment. 
</p>
<p>
How does this translate to a computational approach? The child (or ‘learner’) can be considered an agent who is trying to maximise a reward signal – there are negative rewards for falling (the immediate pain of the fall), and positive rewards for balancing and – eventually– walking (the absence of pain; the benefits of increased mobility). 
</p>
<p>
To make this more concrete, we can simplify this using game based on a simple 3 x 3 grid environment. The goal of the game is simple – to click on squares and collect as high a total reward as possible.  
Through interaction with the game, the user will learn:
<ul> 1. Constraints: The game must start on a specific square; movement from one square to another is based on certain conditions. </ul>
<ul> 2. Reward details: Some squares have a positive reward (+1), others have a negative reward (-1). </ul>
</p>

<p>
After training with the environment, you should be able to hit ‘reset’ and play the game for maximum cumulative reward, which is +3 points, by traversing the diagonal. Through interaction, you would have learned the constraints – the game must begin at the top-left corner, and you can only move along adjacent squares, and the rewards – each square along the diagonal has a positive reward (+1), and all other squares have a negative reward (-1). </p>

<p>These are the basics of reinforcement learning!</p>
