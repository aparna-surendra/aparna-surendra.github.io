<h3> BASICS - A QUICK OVERVIEW </h3>
</header>
<i><a href="new_page2.html">Skip</a> if you're familiar with big-picture conversations in AI </i>
<p></p>
<header>
<h4>1. What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</h4>
</header>
<p>There is no consensus around the definition of AI, or <a href = "www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYfzux7JKHE">the science of making machines intelligent</a>. Today, much of the enthusiasm around AI’s potential focuses on two key characteristics: <b>learning</b> and <b>generality</b>.</p>

<p>
<ul><li>A <b>learning algorithm</b> is one that is not explicitly programmed to find a solution.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A <b>general-purpose algorithm</b> is one that is flexible enough to be applied to new environments and new tasks.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
Humans do this naturally. We can learn without explicit instruction – children are not taught to walk with explicit commands (<i>place your foot at this angle, while moving at this speed </i>), but learn through experience. And we have general-purpose intelligence  – we can learn how to swim, and but we can also learn a variety of other tasks – how to drive, or to speak a new language. 
</p>
<p>
Learning and generality are not the only two characteristics of intelligence, but this primer uses them to frame a working definition of AI. 
</p>
<p>
Consider what types of machines are now excluded from the AI umbrella. Imagine if I entered every possible sequence of chess moves into a machine (assume this was computationally feasible and efficient), and the machine would search its dataset to identify the next move. This would produce a winning machine. But one that was not a learning machine (it relies on human input data), nor general-purpose (it would not be versatile enough to learn another game, such as Scrabble). 
</p>

<h4>2. What is reinforcement learning?</h4>
</header>
<p>
Reinforcement learning is one type of learning algorithm, and its study is one of the most active areas of AI research. RL can be considered a computational approach to learning from interaction – the learner is not told which actions to take, <a href = "http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">but instead must interact with the environment, and discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them.</a>
</p>

<p>
Let’s return to the example of a child learning to walk: the child (or ‘learner’) can be considered an agent who is trying to maximise a reward signal. There are negative rewards for falling (the immediate pain of the fall), and positive rewards for balancing and – eventually– walking (the absence of pain; the benefits of increased mobility). 
</p>

<h4>3. AI and society</h4>
</header>
<p>The conversation around AI is charged by its potential for groundbreaking human advancement. Could AI, coupled with domain-specific knowledge, accelerate discoveries in cancer research or solutions to climate change? But the flip of this enthusiasm is the need for careful, ethical AI development, and the anticipation and close monitoring of the impacts of AI-based systems. </p>


<p>There are already <a href = "https://medium.com/@AINowInstitute/ai-now-law-and-policy-reading-list-641368f09228">active conversations</a> on real-world implications of AI, including on the need for algorithmic fairness and explainability (are certain communities disproportionately impacted by the system; why does the algorithm take a certain action/make a certain prediction). All of these issues are relevant to reinforcement learning, along with a set of RL-specific challenges. These are often bucketed as topics in ‘AI safety’, which is an active area of technical research.</p>
