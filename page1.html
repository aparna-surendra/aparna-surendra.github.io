Reinforcement learning is a method of learning that relies on interaction with an environment. It can be considered a computational approach to how a child learns – we learn how to walk without an explicit teacher, and instead learn which actions to take through trial-and-error, and identifying cause and effect in relation to our physical movement and the environment. 
/n
How does this translate to a computational approach? The child (or ‘learner’) can be considered an agent who is trying to maximise a reward signal – there are negative rewards for falling (the immediate pain of the fall), and positive rewards for balancing and – eventually– walking (the absence of pain; the benefits of increased mobility). 
/n
To make this more concrete, we can simplify this using game based on a simple 3 x 3 grid environment. The goal of the game is simple – to click on squares and collect as high a total reward as possible.  
/n
Through interaction with the game, the user will learn:
1. Constraints: The game must start on a specific square; movement from one square to another is based on certain conditions. 
2. Reward details: Some squares have a positive reward (+1), others have a negative reward (-1).
