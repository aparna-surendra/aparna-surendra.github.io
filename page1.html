    <h1>A reinforcement learning primer </h1>
    <h2>1/5 Introduction</h2>
  </header>
<div id="content">
<div id="" style="overflow-y:scroll; ">
<p>This reinforcement learning (RL) primer introduces RL fundamentals, and explicitly extends them to certain topics in AI research, It hopes to bridge the gap between high-level discussions and technical AI research..</p>

<p>It is divided into two sections:</p> 
	<ul><li>Concepts: Introduces RL intuition and terminology through interactive grids and discussion.</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Calculations: Introduces mathematical notation, additional concepts, and illustrates an algorithm by-hand.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>This primer was designed for those with an interest in AI, but without any specialised knowledge. On completing it, the hope is that the reader will be able to more deeply engagee with technical AI  – whether it be through deeper understanding of <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/science/deep-mind-artificial-intelligence.html">media coverage</a>, or within policy discussions.</p>

<h3> BASICS - A QUICK OVERVIEW </h3>
</header>
<p><b>1. What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</b></p>
<p>There is no consensus around the definition of AI, or <a href = "www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYfzux7JKHE">the science of making machines intelligent</a>. Today, much of the enthusiasm around AI’s potential focuses on two key characteristics: <b>learning</b> and <b>generality</b>.</p>

<p>
<ul><li>A <b>learning algorithm</b> is one that is not explicitly programmed to find a solution.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A <b>general-purpose algorithm</b> is one that is flexible enough to be applied to new environments and new tasks.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
Humans do this naturally: we can learn without explicit instruction (children are not taught to walk with explicit commands – place your foot at this angle, while moving at this speed– rather, they develop this through experience), and we have general-purpose intelligence (we can learn how to swim, and but we can also learn a variety of other tasks – how to drive, or to speak a new language). 
</p>
<p>
Learning and generality are not the only two characteristics of intelligence (the description of a child walking is fairly simplistic), but this primer uses them to frame a working definition of AI. 
</p>
<p>
Consider what types of machines are now excluded from the AI umbrella. Imagine if I entered every possible sequence of chess moves into a machine (extend your imagination to consider this computationally feasible and efficient), and the machine would simply search its database to identify the next move. This would doubtless provide a winning machine. But it would neither be a learning machine (it relies on human input data) or a general-purpose one (it would not be versatile enough to play another game, such as scrabble). 
</p>

<p><b>2. What is reinforcement learning?</b></p>
<p>
Reinforcement learning is one type of learning algorithm, and its study is one of the most active areas of AI research. RL can be considered a computational approach to learning from interaction – the learner is not told which actions to take, <a href = "http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">but instead must interact with the environment, and discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them.</a>
</p>

<p>
Let’s return to the example of a child learning to walk: the child (or ‘learner’) can be considered an agent who is trying to maximise a reward signal. There are negative rewards for falling (the immediate pain of the fall), and positive rewards for balancing and – eventually– walking (the absence of pain; the benefits of increased mobility). 
</p>

<p><b>3. TL;DR - The issues </b></p>
<p>The conversation around AI is charged by its potential for groundbreaking human advancement. Could AI, coupled with domain-specific knowledge, accelerate discoveries in cancer research or climate change? But the flip of this enthusiasm is the need for careful, ethical AI development, and the anticipation and close monitoring of the impacts of AI-based systems. </p>


<p>There are already <a href = "https://medium.com/@AINowInstitute/ai-now-law-and-policy-reading-list-641368f09228">active conversations</a> on real-world implications of AI, including on the need for algorithmic fairness and explainability (are certain communities disproportionately impacted by the system; why does the algorithm take a certain action/make a certain prediction). All of these issues are relevant to reinforcement learning, along with a set of RL-specific challenges. These are often bucketed as topics in ‘AI safety’, which is an active area of technical research.</p>
