Consider a larger grid (20 x 20), with one new rule â€“ the game ends after 300 moves or 5 minutes, at which you must begin a new game. The grid has the same action constraints as the previous grid. The first move has been made for you. 
<div align="center">
<div id="grid"></div>
<script src="grids/grid2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>
<p>You play two games to 300 moves, and reveal the following values. </p>
<div class = "row">
<div class="column">
<div id="grid2"></div>
<script src="grids/grid4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>
 <div class="column">
<div id="grid5"></div>
<script src="grids/grid5.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>
</div>
<p>You have discovered a strategy that will yield 180 points: play all the blue +1 squares for a total of 180 points, avoid the orange -1 squares, and wait for the clock to run out. You can choose to play this strategy or you can choose to play another game to explore the grey squares. </p>
<p>
What do you do next: play a known 180 point game, or a game with unknown rewards (but potentially as low as 60 points)?
</p>
<div class = "row"> 
<div class="column">
<div id="grid6"></div>
<script src="grids/grid6.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>
<div class="column">
<div id="grid7"></div>
<script src="grids/grid7.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>
</div>
<p>As it turns out, there is a cluster of blue +1 rewards that had yet to be discovered. The optimal total rewards for this game isn't +180, but +238. This dilemma, between 'exploiting' a known optimal strategy, or 'exploring' further is known as the exploration-exploitation trade-off. </p>
